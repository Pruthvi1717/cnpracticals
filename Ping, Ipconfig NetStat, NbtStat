Here's a brief explanation and implementation guide for the network commands `ping`, `ipconfig` (replaced by `ifconfig` on Ubuntu), `netstat`, and `nbtstat` (replaced by `nmblookup` for similar functionality in Ubuntu):

### 1. `ping`
- **Purpose**: To test the connectivity to another network device and measure round-trip time for messages sent from the local host to a destination device.
- **Usage on Ubuntu**: 
  ```bash
  ping [destination]
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  ping google.com
  ```
- **Explanation**: Sends ICMP echo requests to the specified destination and listens for replies, reporting the round-trip time for each packet.

### 2. `ifconfig` (similar to `ipconfig` in Windows)
- **Purpose**: To view or configure a network interfaceâ€™s IP address, netmask, and other parameters.
- **Usage on Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
  - Note: `ifconfig` may be deprecated on some newer Ubuntu systems; `ip` is preferred:
    ```bash
    ip address show
    ```
- **Explanation**: Displays the configuration details of all active network interfaces on the system, such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and more.

### 3. `netstat`
- **Purpose**: To display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.
- **Usage on Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  netstat -a
  ```
- **Explanation**: Lists all active connections, listening ports, and other network-related statistics. Useful for diagnosing network issues or monitoring traffic.

### 4. `nbtstat` (replaced by `nmblookup` in Ubuntu)
- **Purpose**: `nbtstat` is a Windows command used to troubleshoot NetBIOS over TCP/IP. On Ubuntu, `nmblookup` serves a similar purpose.
- **Usage on Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  nmblookup -A [IP Address]
  ```
- **Explanation**: Queries NetBIOS names and maps IP addresses to NetBIOS names for devices within the same network. This is commonly used in local area networks (LANs) to resolve computer names.

### Running Commands in Terminal:
1. **To test network connectivity using `ping`**:
   ```bash
   ping -c 4 example.com
   ```
   (`-c 4` sends 4 packets and stops)

2. **To check network configuration using `ifconfig`**:
   ```bash
   ifconfig
   ```
   - Or, using the preferred `ip` command:
     ```bash
     ip a
     ```

3. **To check network statistics using `netstat`**:
   ```bash
   netstat -tuln
   ```
   (`-t` for TCP, `-u` for UDP, `-l` for listening, `-n` to show numeric addresses)

4. **To look up NetBIOS names using `nmblookup`**:
   ```bash
   nmblookup -A 192.168.1.1
   ```
