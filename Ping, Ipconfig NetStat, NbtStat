1. Ping
Purpose:
The ping command is used to test the connectivity between your computer and another device on the network (it can be a website, server, or another computer). It sends an ICMP Echo Request message to the target and waits for an ICMP Echo Reply message. This helps check if the target is reachable and how long it takes for a packet to travel from your machine to the target and back.

Command Usage:
Windows Command Line (CMD) or Linux/macOS Terminal:
bash
Copy code
ping <hostname or IP address>
Example:
To test if Google’s website is reachable:

bash
Copy code
ping google.com
This will send several packets to google.com and report the round-trip time for each packet.

Output Explanation:
Reply from <IP>: The response from the target device.
Time: The round-trip time for the packet, usually measured in milliseconds (ms).
TTL (Time to Live): The number of hops the packet took to reach the target.
2. Ipconfig (Windows) / Ifconfig (Linux/macOS)
Purpose:
The ipconfig (on Windows) or ifconfig (on Linux/macOS) command displays the IP configuration of your computer, including details about the network interfaces such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. It can also show DNS information and allow you to release or renew your IP address.

Command Usage:
Windows:

bash
Copy code
ipconfig
Linux/macOS:

bash
Copy code
ifconfig
Example:
To view the IP configuration on a Windows machine:

bash
Copy code
ipconfig
Output Explanation:
IPv4 Address: The unique address that identifies your device on the network (e.g., 192.168.1.2).
Subnet Mask: A mask that determines which part of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the device.
Default Gateway: The router or gateway that connects your local network to external networks (such as the internet).
DNS Servers: The addresses of DNS servers that your machine uses to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
3. Netstat
Purpose:
netstat stands for Network Statistics and is used to display information about active network connections, listening ports, routing tables, and interface statistics. It is very useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues or for monitoring open ports and network activity.

Command Usage:
bash
Copy code
netstat [options]
Common Options:
-a: Shows all active connections and listening ports.
-n: Displays addresses and port numbers in numeric format (without trying to resolve hostnames).
-o: Displays the process ID (PID) associated with each connection.
-p: Displays connections for a specific protocol (TCP or UDP).
Example:
To view all active connections and listening ports:

bash
Copy code
netstat -an
Output Explanation:
Proto: The protocol being used (e.g., TCP or UDP).
Local Address: The local IP address and port on your machine.
Foreign Address: The IP address and port of the remote machine (if applicable).
State: The current state of the connection (e.g., LISTENING, ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT).
4. NbtStat
Purpose:
The nbtstat command is used to display NetBIOS over TCP/IP information, such as NetBIOS names, active sessions, and the name resolution status. It’s most often used for troubleshooting Windows network issues, particularly when dealing with network shares or file sharing over TCP/IP.

Command Usage:
bash
Copy code
nbtstat [options]
Common Options:
-n: Displays the local NetBIOS name table, which shows the NetBIOS names that are currently in use on the computer.
-r: Displays the resolved names and their status.
-s: Displays the NetBIOS session statistics.
Example:
To view the local NetBIOS name table:

bash
Copy code
nbtstat -n
Output Explanation:
Name: The NetBIOS name assigned to the computer.
Type: The type of name (e.g., <00> for workgroup name, <20> for server name).
Status: The current status of the name (e.g., Registered).
Summary of Commands and Their Functions
Ping: Tests network connectivity by sending ICMP Echo requests to a target.

Example: ping google.com
Output: Shows round-trip time and packet loss.
Ipconfig (Windows) / Ifconfig (Linux/macOS): Displays the network interface configuration, including IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.

Example (Windows): ipconfig
Example (Linux/macOS): ifconfig
Output: Shows IP configuration and network details.
Netstat: Displays network connections, listening ports, and routing tables.

Example: netstat -an
Output: Shows active connections, their states, and port usage.
NbtStat: Displays NetBIOS over TCP/IP statistics and name resolution information.

Example: nbtstat -n
Output: Displays the NetBIOS name table and active sessions.
These commands are essential tools for monitoring, troubleshooting, and configuring your computer’s network connection. They can be run in the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux/macOS) for quick diagnostics and system checks.
