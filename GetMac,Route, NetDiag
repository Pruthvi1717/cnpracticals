Hereâ€™s how you can implement and understand the functionality of network commands in Ubuntu that are equivalent to `GetMac`, `Route`, and `NetDiag` in Windows:

---

### 1. `GetMac` Equivalent
- **Purpose**: To display the MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of the network interfaces.
- **Equivalent in Ubuntu**: Use `ip` or `ifconfig`
- **Usage**:
  - Using `ip`:
    ```bash
    ip link show
    ```
  - Using `ifconfig`:
    ```bash
    ifconfig -a
    ```
- **Explanation**: 
  - `ip link show` lists all the network interfaces and shows their MAC addresses (referred to as "link/ether").
  - `ifconfig -a` provides details of all interfaces, including their MAC addresses, shown as "ether".

### 2. `Route`
- **Purpose**: To display and modify the IP routing table.
- **Usage in Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  route -n
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - `route -n` displays the routing table, showing the network destination, gateway, netmask, and interface.
  - The `-n` flag ensures the output is shown in numeric format, which speeds up the command since it avoids resolving names.
- **Example**:
  - To add a route (example to add a default gateway):
    ```bash
    sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1
    ```
  - To delete a route:
    ```bash
    sudo route del -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
    ```

### 3. `NetDiag` Equivalent
- **Purpose**: `NetDiag` in Windows is used to diagnose and troubleshoot network problems. In Ubuntu, a combination of tools can be used for similar diagnostics.
- **Tools to Use in Ubuntu**:
  1. **`ping`**: To check connectivity.
     ```bash
     ping -c 4 google.com
     ```
  2. **`traceroute`**: To trace the route to a destination.
     ```bash
     traceroute google.com
     ```
  3. **`mtr`**: A combination of `ping` and `traceroute` for real-time diagnostics.
     ```bash
     mtr google.com
     ```
  4. **`ifconfig` or `ip`**: To check network interface status.
     ```bash
     ip address show
     ```
  5. **`netstat`**: To display network connections and routing tables.
     ```bash
     netstat -tuln
     ```
- **Explanation**:
  - **`ping`**: Tests if a network device is reachable.
  - **`traceroute`**: Finds the path taken to reach a destination, helping diagnose routing issues.
  - **`mtr`**: Continuously tracks the route and shows packet loss and latency.
  - **`netstat`**: Useful for viewing active connections and open ports.
  - **`ip`/`ifconfig`**: Checks network interface details and status.

### Summary of Each Command
1. **`ip link show`** (for MAC address):
   - **Purpose**: Lists all network interfaces and their MAC addresses.
   - **Usage**: Useful to identify devices on the network.

2. **`route -n`**:
   - **Purpose**: Displays the routing table.
   - **Usage**: Helps to understand how network traffic is routed.

3. **Diagnostic Tools (`ping`, `traceroute`, `mtr`, `netstat`)**:
   - **Purpose**: Diagnose and troubleshoot network connectivity and performance issues.
   - **Usage**: Used collectively to identify where network problems may be occurring.
