ntroduction to TELNET
Last Updated : 24 Jun, 2024
TELNET stands for Teletype Network. It is a client/server application protocol that provides access to virtual terminals of remote systems on local area networks or the Internet. The local computer uses a telnet client program and the remote computers use a telnet server program. In this article, we will discuss every point about TELNET.

What is Telnet?
TELNET is a type of protocol that enables one computer to connect to the local computer. It is used as a standard TCP/IP protocol for virtual terminal service which is provided by ISO. The computer which starts the connection is known as the local computer. The computer which is being connected to i.e. which accepts the connection known as the remote computer. During telnet operation, whatever is being performed on the remote computer will be displayed by the local computer. Telnet operates on a client/server principle.

History of TELNET
The Telnet protocol originated in the late 1960s, it was created to provide remote terminal access and control over mainframes and minicomputers. Initially, it was designed to be a simple and secure method of connecting to a remote system. This protocol allowed users to access remote computers using a terminal or command-line interface. Over time, Telnet’s use has diminished due to security concerns, and alternatives like SSH are now preferred for secure remote management

Logging in TELNET
The logging process can be further categorized into two parts:

Local Login
Remote Login
1. Local Login
Whenever a user logs into its local system, it is known as local login.

The Procedure of Local Login

Keystrokes are accepted by the terminal driver when the user types at the terminal.
Terminal Driver passes these characters to OS.
Now, OS validates the combination of characters and opens the required application.
2. Remote Login
Remote Login is a process in which users can log in to a remote site i.e. computer and use services that are available on the remote computer. With the help of remote login, a user is able to understand the result of transferring the result of processing from the remote computer to the local computer.

The Procedure of Remote Login
When the user types something on the local computer, the local operating system accepts the character.
The local computer does not interpret the characters, it will send them to the TELNET client.
TELNET client transforms these characters to a universal character set called Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) characters and it will pass them to the local TCP/IP protocol Stack.
Commands or text which are in the form of NVT, travel through the Internet and it will arrive at the TCP/IP stack at the remote computer.
Characters are then delivered to the operating system and later on passed to the TELNET server.
Then TELNET server changes those characters to characters that can be understandable by a remote computer.
The remote operating system receives characters from a pseudo-terminal driver, which is a piece of software that pretends that characters are coming from a terminal.
The operating system then passes the character to the appropriate application program.
Network Virtual Terminal(NVT)
NVT (Network Virtual Terminal) is a virtual terminal in TELNET that has a fundamental structure that is shared by many different types of real terminals. NVT (Network Virtual Terminal) was created to make communication viable between different types of terminals with different operating systems.

How TELNET Works?
Client-Server Interaction
The Telnet client initiates the connection by sending requests to the Telnet server.
Once the connection is established, the client can send commands to the server.
The server processes these commands and responds accordingly.
Character Flow
When the user types on the local computer, the local operating system accepts the characters.
The Telnet client transforms these characters into a universal character set called Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) characters.
These NVT characters travel through the Internet to the remote computer via the local TCP/IP protocol stack.
The remote Telnet server converts these characters into a format understandable by the remote computer.
The remote operating system receives the characters from a pseudo-terminal driver and passes them to the appropriate application program3.
Network Virtual Terminal (NVT)
NVT is a virtual terminal in Telnet that provides a common structure shared by different types of real terminals.
It ensures communication compatibility between various terminals with different operating systems.
TELNET Commands
Commands of Telnet are identified by a prefix character, Interpret As Command (IAC) with code 255. IAC is followed by command and option codes. The basic format of the command is as shown in the following figure :

Following are some of the important TELNET commands:

 	Decimal 
 	  Binary  
 	                  Meaning 
 
WILL	251	11111011	1. Offering to enable. 
2. Accepting a request to enable. 
 
WON’T	252	11111100	1. Rejecting a request to enable. 
2. Offering to disable. 
3. Accepting a request to disable. 
 
DO	253	11111101`	1. Approving a request to enable. 
2. Requesting to enable. 
 
DON’T	254	11111110	1. Disapproving a request to enable. 
2. Approving an offer to disable. 
3. Requesting to disable. 
 
Following are some common options used with the telnet:

Installing Telnet
In this section, we will walk you through the process of installing telnet in RPM and DEB systems.

Installation of Telnet in CentOS 7 / RHEL 7
To begin the installation process on the server, run the command

# yum install telnet telnet-server -y
Sample OutputInstall Telnet Telnet ServerNext, Start and enable the telnet service by issuing the command below

 
# systemctl start telnet.socket
# systemctl enable telnet.socket
Sample OutputStart And Enable TelnetNext, allow port 23 which is the native port that telnet uses on the firewall.

# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=23/tcp
Finally, reload the firewall for the rule to take effect.

# firewall-cmd --reload
Sample OutputAllow Port 23 Over FirewallTo verify the status of telnet run

# systemctl status telnet.socket
Sample OutputCheck Status Of Telnet In CentOS 7Telnet protocol is now ready for use. Next, we are going to create a login user.

Creating a login user
In this example, we will create a login user for logging in using the telnet protocol.

# adduser telnetuser
Create a password for the user.

# passwd telnetuser
Specify the password and confirm. To use telnet command to log in to a server, use the syntax below.

$ telnet server-IP address
For example

$ telnet 38.76.11.19
In the black console, specify the username and password.Telnet Ip AddressTo login using putty, enter the server’s IP address and click on the ‘Telnet’ radio button as shown.Telnet Putty ConfigurationFinally, click on the ‘Open’ button. On the console screen, provide the username and password of the userLogging In To Centos Via Telnet In Putty

Installation of Telnet in Ubuntu 18.04
To install telnet protocol in Ubuntu 18.04 execute:

$ sudo apt install telnetd -y
Sample OutputInstall Telnet On UbuntuTo check whether telnet service is running, execute the command.

$ systemctl status inetd
Sample OutputSystemctl Status InetdNext, we need to open port 23 in ufw firewall.

$ ufw allow 23/tcp
Sample OutputAllow Port 23 Over Ufw FirewallFinally, reload the firewall to effect the changes.

$ ufw reload
Reload ufw FirewallTelnet has been successfully installed and ready for use. Like in the previous example in CentOS 7, you need to create a login user and log in using the same syntax.

Using telnet to check for open ports
Telnet can also be used to check if a specific port is open on a server. To do so, use the syntax below.

$ telnet server-IP port
For example, to check if port 22 is open on a server, run

$ telnet 38.76.11.19  22
