Hereâ€™s how to implement the network troubleshooting commands `nslookup`, `traceroute` (similar to `tracert` in Windows), and a Linux alternative to `pingpath`.

---

### 1. `nslookup`
- **Purpose**: To query DNS servers to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  nslookup google.com
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - This command queries the DNS to find the IP address associated with a domain (or vice versa).
  - It provides details about the DNS server used and the answer received, helpful for diagnosing DNS resolution issues.

### 2. `traceroute` (similar to `tracert` in Windows)
- **Purpose**: To trace the route packets take to a destination, showing each hop on the way and the delay at each point.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  traceroute google.com
  ```
  - If `traceroute` is not installed, you can install it using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install traceroute
    ```
- **Explanation**:
  - This command sends packets to the destination and tracks each router (hop) the packets pass through.
  - Useful for diagnosing network issues by showing where packets are delayed or lost.

### 3. **`pingpath` Alternative in Linux**
- **Note**: `pingpath` is not a standard command in Linux. However, similar functionality can be achieved using a combination of `mtr` (My Traceroute), which combines the features of `ping` and `traceroute`.
- **Installing `mtr`**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install mtr
  ```
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  mtr google.com
  ```
- **Explanation**:
  - `mtr` provides a continuous, real-time view of the route packets take to the destination, combining ping and traceroute functionalities.
  - It shows packet loss and latency to each hop, updating dynamically, making it more comprehensive for network diagnostics.

### Summary of Each Command
1. **`nslookup`**:
   - **Purpose**: Query DNS for domain-to-IP mappings.
   - **Usage**: Helps verify if DNS resolution is working correctly.

2. **`traceroute`**:
   - **Purpose**: Trace the path packets take to a destination.
   - **Usage**: Useful for identifying where network delays or failures occur.

3. **`mtr`**:
   - **Purpose**: Real-time analysis of the packet path, combining ping and traceroute.
   - **Usage**: Provides a continuous overview of network performance, highlighting packet loss and latency.

These commands are essential for diagnosing network issues and understanding packet travel paths. Let me know if you need more details or examples!
